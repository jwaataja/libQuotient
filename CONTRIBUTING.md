# Contributing

Feedback and contributions are very welcome!

Here's help on how to make contributions, divided into the following sections:

The quick-read part:
* general information,
* vulnerability reporting,
* documentation.

The long-read part:
* code changes,
* how to check proposed changes before submitting them,
* reuse of other libraries, frameworks etc.

## General information

For specific proposals, please provide them as
[pull requests](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/pulls)
or
[issues](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/issues)
For general discussion, feel free to use our Matrix room:
[#quotient:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#quotient:matrix.org).

If you're new to the project (or FLOSS in general),
[issues tagged as easy](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/labels/easy)
are smaller tasks that don't require much knowledge about the project.
You are welcome aboard!

### Pull requests and different branches recommended

Pull requests are preferred, since they are specific.
See the GitHub Help [articles about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
to learn how to deal with them.

We recommend creating different branches for different (logical)
changes, and creating a pull request when you're done; the development
integration branch is `dev`. See the GitHub documentation on
[creating branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
and
[using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### How we handle proposals

We use GitHub to track all changes via its
[issue tracker](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/pulls).
Specific changes are proposed using those mechanisms.
Issues are assigned to an individual who works on it and then marks it complete.
If there are questions or objections, the conversation area of that
issue or pull request is used to resolve it.

<!--
### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) - not enforced yet

All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to
the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1](doc/dco.txt).
This is exactly the same one created and used by the Linux kernel developers
and posted on <http://developercertificate.org/>.
This is a developer's certification that he or she has the right to
submit the patch for inclusion into the project.

Simply submitting a contribution implies this agreement, however,
please include a "Signed-off-by" tag in every patch
(this tag is a conventional way to confirm that you agree to the DCO).
You can do this with <tt>git commit --signoff</tt> (the <tt>-s</tt> flag
is a synonym for <tt>--signoff</tt>).

Another way to do this is to write the following at the end of the commit
message, on a line by itself separated by a blank line from the body of
the commit:

    Signed-off-by: YOUR NAME <YOUR.EMAIL@EXAMPLE.COM>

You can signoff by default in this project by creating a file
(say "git-template") that contains
some blank lines and the signed-off-by text above;
then configure git to use that as a commit template.  For example:

    git config commit.template ~/cii-best-practices-badge/git-template

It's not practical to fix old contributions in git, so if one is forgotten,
do not try to fix them.  We presume that if someone sometimes used a DCO,
a commit without a DCO is an accident and the DCO still applies.

### License

Unless a contributor explicitly specifies otherwise, we assume contributors
to agree that all contributed code is released either under *LGPL v2.1 or later*.
This is more than just [LGPL v2.1 libQuotient now uses](./COPYING)
because the project plans to switch to LGPL v3 for library code in the near future.

## Vulnerability reporting (security issues) - see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)

## Documentation changes

Most of the documentation is in Markdown format. All Markdown files use the .md
filename extension. Any help on fixing/extending these is more than welcome.

Where reasonable, limit yourself to Markdown that will be accepted by different
markdown processors (e.g., what is specified by CommonMark or the original
Markdown). In practice, as long as libQuotient is hosted at GitHub,
[GFM (GitHub-flavoured Markdown)](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)
is used to show those files in a browser, so it's fine to use its extensions.
In particular, you can mark code snippets with the programming language used;
blank lines separate paragraphs, newlines inside a paragraph do *not* force a line break.

Beware - this is *not* the same markdown algorithm used by GitHub when it
renders issue or pull comments; in those cases
[newlines in paragraph-like content are considered as real line breaks](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/);
unfortunately this other algorithm is *also* called GitHub-flavoured markdown.
(Yes, it'd be better if there were different names for different things.)

In your markdown, please don't use tab characters and avoid "bare" URLs.
In a hyperlink, the link text and URL should be on the same line.
While historically we didn't care about the line length in markdown texts
(and more often than not put the whole paragraph into one line), this is no more
recommended; instead, try to use 80-character limit (similar to the limit for
C/C++ code) _except hyperlinks_ - wrapping breaks them.

Do not use trailing two spaces for line breaks, since these cannot be seen
and may be silently removed by some tools. If, for whatever reason, a blank line
is not an option, use <tt>&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;</tt> (an HTML break).

## End of TL;DR

If you don't plan/have substantial contributions, you can stop reading here.
Further sections are for those who's going to actively hack on the library code.

## Code changes

The code should strive to be DRY (don't repeat yourself), clear, and obviously
correct (i.e. buildable). Some technical debt is inevitable,
just don't bankrupt us with it. Refactoring is welcome.

### Code style and formatting

As of Quotient 0.7, the C++ standard for newly written code is C++20.

The code style is defined by `.clang-format`, and in general, all C++ files
should follow it. Files with minor deviations from the defined style are still
accepted in PRs; however, unless explicitly marked with `// clang-format off`
and `// clang-format on`, these deviations will be rectified any commit soon
after.

Notable things from .clang-format:
* 4-space indents, no tabs, no trailing spaces, no last empty lines. If you
  spot the code abusing these - thank you for fixing it.
* Prefer keeping lines within 80 characters. Slight overflows are ok only
  if that helps readability.
  
Additionally:
* Please don't make "hypocritical structs" with protected or private members.
  In general, `struct` is used to denote a plain-old-data structure, rather
  than data+behaviour. If you need access control or are adding yet another
  non-trivial (construction, assignment) member function to a `struct`,
  just make it a `class` instead.
* For newly created classes, keep to
  [the rule of 3/5/0](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three) -
  make sure to read about the rule of zero if you haven't before, it's not
  what you might think it is.
* Qt containers are generally preferred to STL containers; however, there are
  notable exceptions, and libQuotient already uses them:
  * `std::array` and `std::deque` have no direct counterparts in Qt.
  * Because of COW semantics, Qt containers cannot hold uncopyable classes.
    Classes without a default constructor are a problem too. Examples of that
    are `SyncRoomData` and `EventsArray<>`. Use STL containers for structures
    having those but see the next point and also consider if you can supply
    a reasonable copy/default constructor.
  * STL containers can be freely used in code internal to a translation unit
    (i.e., in a certain .cpp file) _as long as that is not exposed in the API_.
    It's ok to use, e.g., `std::vector` instead of `QVector` to tighten up
    code where you don't need COW, or when dealing with uncopyable
    data structures (see the previous point). However, exposing STL containers
    in the API is not encouraged (except where absolutely necessary, e.g. we use
    `std::deque` for a timeline). Especially when it comes to API intended
    for usage from QML (e.g. `Q_PROPERTY`), STL containers or iterators are
    unlikely to work and therefore unlikely to be accepted into `dev`.
  * Notwithstanding the above (you're not going to use them with QML anyway),
    prefer `std::unique_ptr<>` over `QScopedPointer<>` as it gives stronger
    guarantees.
* Always use `QVector` instead of `QList` unless Qt's own API uses it - see the
  [great article by Marc Mutz on Qt containers](https://marcmutz.wordpress.com/effective-qt/containers/)
  for details. With Qt 6, these two become the same type matching what used
  to be `QVector` in Qt 5.

### API conventions

Calls, data structures and other symbols not intended for use by clients
should _not_ be exposed in (public) .h files, unless they are necessary
to declare other public symbols. In particular, this involves private members
(functions, typedefs, or variables) in public classes; use pimpl idiom to hide
implementation details as much as possible. `_impl` namespace is reserved for
definitions that should not be used by clients and are not covered by
API guarantees.

Note: As of now, all header files of libQuotient are considered public;
this may change eventually.

### Comments

Whenever you add a new call to the library API that you expect to be used
from client code, make sure to supply a proper doc-comment along with the call.
Quotient uses the Doxygen style; some legacy code may use Javadoc style but it
is not encouraged any more. Some parts are not documented at all;
adding doc-comments to them is highly encouraged and is a great first-time
contribution.

Use `\brief` for the summary, and follow with details after
an empty doc-comment line, using `\param`, `\return` etc. as necessary.

For in-code comments, the advice is as follows:
* Don't restate what's happening in the code unless it's not really obvious.
  We assume the readers to have some command of C++ and Qt. If your code is
  not obvious, consider making it clearer itself before commenting.
* That said, both C++ and Qt have their arcane features and dark corners,
  and we don't want to limit anybody who feels they have a case for
  variadic templates, raw literals, and so on. Use your experience to figure
  what might be less well-known to readers and comment such cases: leave
  references to web pages, Quotient wiki etc.
* Make sure to document not so much "what" but more "why" certain code is done
  the way it is. In the worst case, the logic of the code can be
  reverse-engineered; but you can almost never reverse-engineer the line of
  reasoning and the pitfalls avoided.

### Automated tests

We gradually introduce autotests based on a combination of CTest and Qt Test
frameworks - see `autotests/` directory. There are very few of those, as we
have just started adding those to the new code (you guessed it; adding more
tests to the old code is very welcome).

Aside from that, libQuotient comes with a command-line end-to-end test suite
called Quotest. Any significant addition to the library API should be
accompanied by a respective test in `autotests/` and/or in Quotest.

To add a test to autotests:
- In a new .cpp file in `autotests/`, define a test class derived from
  QObject with `private Q_SLOTS:` section having the member functions called
  for testing. If you feel more comfortable using a header file to define
  the class, feel free to do so. If you're new to Qt Test framework, use
  existing tests as a guidance.
- Add a `quotient_add_test` macro call with your test to
  `autotests/CMakeLists.txt`

To add a test to Quotest:
- In `quotest.cpp`, add a new test to the `TestSuite` class. Similar to Qt Test,
  each test in Quotest is a private slot; unlike Qt Test, you should use
  special macros, `TEST_DECL()` and `TEST_IMPL()`, to declare and define
  the test (those macros conceal passing the testing handle in `thisTest`
  variable to the test method).
- In the test function definition, add test logic using `FINISH_TEST` macro
  to check for the test outcome and complete the test (be mindful that
  `FINISH_TEST` always `return`s, not only in case of error). ALL (even failing)
  branches should conclude with a `FINISH_TEST` (or `FAIL_TEST` that is
  a shortcut for a failing `FINISH_TEST`) invocation, unless you intend to have
  a "DID NOT FINISH" message in the logs in certain conditions.

The `TestManager` class sets up some basic test fixture to help you with testing;
notably, the tests can rely on having an initialised `Room` object with loaded
state for the test room in `targetRoom` member variable. Note that it's normal
for tests to go async, which is not something Qt Test is easy with (and this
is why Quotest doesn't directly use Qt Test but rather fetches a few ideas
from it).

### Security, privacy, and performance

Pay attention to security, and work *with*, not against, the usual security hardening practices (however few in C++).

`char *` and similar unchecked C-style read/write arrays are forbidden - use
Qt containers or at the very least `std::array<>` instead. Where you see fit
(usually with data structures), try to use smart pointers, especially
`std::unique_ptr<>` or `QScopedPointer` instead of bare pointers. When dealing
with `QObject`s, use the parent-child ownership semantics exercised by Qt
(this is preferred to using smart pointers). If you find a particular use case
where the strict semantic of unique pointers doesn't help and a shared pointer
is necessary, feel free to step up with the working code and it will be
considered for inclusion.

Exercise the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) where reasonable and appropriate. Prefer less-coupled cohesive code.

Protect private information, in particular passwords and email addresses.
Absolutely _don't_ spill around this information in logs, and only display
those in UI where really needed. Do not forget about local access to data
(in particular, be very careful when storing something in temporary files,
let alone permanent configuration or state). Avoid mechanisms that could be
used for tracking where possible (we do need to verify people are logged in
but that's pretty much it), and ensure that third parties can't use interactions
for tracking. Matrix protocols evolve towards decoupling
the personally identifiable information from user activity entirely - follow
this trend.

We want the software to have decent performance for users even on weaker
machines. At the same time we keep libQuotient single-threaded as much
as possible, to keep the code simple. That means being cautious about operation
complexity (read about big-O notation if you need a kickstart on the subject).
This especially refers to operations on the whole timeline and the list of
users - each of these can have tens of thousands of elements so even operations
with linear complexity, if heavy enough (with I/O or complex processing),
can produce noticeable GUI freezing or stuttering. When you don't see a way
to reduce algorithmic complexity, either split processing into isolated
pieces that can be individually scheduled as queued events (see the end of
`Connection::consumeRoomData()` to get the idea) or uncouple the logic from
GUI and execute it outside of the main thread with `QtConcurrent` facilities.

Having said that, there's always a trade-off between various attributes;
in particular, readability and maintainability of the code is more important
than squeezing every bit out of that clumsy algorithm. Beware of premature
optimization and profile the code before before diving into hardcore tweaking
that might not give the benefits you think it would.

Speaking of profiling logs (see README.md on how to turn them on) - if you
expect some code to take considerable (more than 10k "simple operations") time
you might want to setup a `QElapsedTimer` and drop the elapsed time into logs
under `PROFILER` logging category. See the existing code for examples -
`room.cpp` has quite a few. In order to reduce small timespan logging spam,
`PROFILER` log lines are usually guarded by a check that the timer counted big
enough time (200 microseconds by default, 20 microseconds for tighter parts).

### Generated C++ code for CS API
The code in `lib/csapi`, `lib/identity` and `lib/application-service`, although
it resides in Git, is actually generated from the official Swagger/OpenAPI
definition files. If you're unhappy with something in there and want to improve
the code, you have to understand the way these files are produced and setup
some additional tooling. The shortest possible procedure resembling
the below text can be found in .github/workflows/ci.yml (our CI configuration
tests regeneration of those files). As described below, there is also a handy
build target for CMake.

#### Why generate the code at all?
Because otherwise we have to do monkey business of writing boilerplate code,
with the same patterns, types etc., literally, for every single API endpoint,
and one of libQuotient authors got fed up with it at some point in time.
By then about 15 job classes were written; the entire API is about 100 endpoints
and counting. Besides, the existing jobs had to be updated according to changes
in CS API that have been, and will keep, coming. Other considerations can be
found in [this talk about API description languages](https://youtu.be/W5TmRozH-rg)
that also briefly touches on GTAD.

#### Prerequisites for CS API code generation
1. Get the source code of GTAD and its dependencies. Recent libQuotient
   includes GTAD as a submodule so you can get everything you need by updating
   gtad/gtad submodule in libQuotient sources:
   `git submodule update --init --recursive gtad/gtad`.

   You can also just clone GTAD sources to keep them separate from libQuotient:
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/quotient-im/gtad.git`
2. Configure and build GTAD: same as libQuotient, it uses CMake so this should
   be quite straightforward (if not - you're probably not quite ready for this
   stuff anyway).
3. Get Matrix CS API definitions from a matrix-spec repo. Although the official
   repo is at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec.git` (formerly
   https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc.git), you may or may not be able
   to generate working code from it because the way it evolves is not
   necessarily in line with libQuotient needs. For that reason, a soft fork
   of the official definitions is kept at
   https://github.com/quotient-im/matrix-spec.git that guarantees buildability
   of the generated code. This repo closely follows the official one (but maybe
   not its freshest commit), applying a few adjustments on top. And of course
   you can use your own repository if you need to change the API definition.
4. If you plan to submit a PR with the generated code to libQuotient or just
   would like it to be properly formatted, you should either ensure you have
   clang-format (version 10 at least) in your PATH or pass
   `-DCLANG_FORMAT=<path>` to CMake, as mentioned in the next section.

#### Generating CS API contents
1. Pass additional configuration to CMake when configuring libQuotient:
   `-DMATRIX_SPEC_PATH=/path/to/matrix-spec/ -DGTAD_PATH=/path/to/gtad`.
   Note that `MATRIX_SPEC_PATH` should lead to the repo while `GTAD_PATH` should
   have the path to GTAD binary. If you need to specify where your clang-format
   is (see the previous section) add `-DCLANG_FORMAT=/path/to/clang-format` to
   the line above. If everything's right, the detected locations will be
   mentioned in CMake output and will trigger configuration of an additional
   build target called `update-api`.
2. Generate the code: `cmake --build <your build dir> --target update-api`.
   Building this target will create (overwriting without warning) source files
   in `lib/csapi`, `lib/identity`, `lib/application-service` for all YAML files
   it can find in `/path/to/matrix-spec/data/api/client-server` and their
   dependencies.

#### Changing generated code
See the more detailed description of what GTAD is and how it works in the documentation on GTAD in its source repo. Only parts specific for libQuotient are described here.

GTAD uses the following three kinds of sources:
1. OpenAPI files. Each file is treated as a separate source (unlike
   swagger-codegen, you do _not_ need to have a single file for the whole API).
2. A configuration file, in Quotient case it's `gtad/gtad.yaml` - common for
   all OpenAPI files GTAD is invoked on.
3. Source code template files: `gtad/*.mustache` - are also common.

The Mustache files have a templated (not in C++ sense) definition of a network
job class derived from BaseJob; if necessary, data structure definitions used
by this job are put before the job class. Bigger Mustache files look a bit
hideous for a newcomer; and the only known highlighter that can handle
the combination of Mustache (originally a web templating language) and C++ can
be found in CLion IDE. Fortunately, all our Mustache files are reasonably
concise and well-formatted these days.
To simplify things some reusable Mustache blocks are defined in `gtad.yaml` -
see its `mustache:` section. Adventurous souls that would like to figure
what's going on in these files should speak up in the Quotient room -
I (Kitsune) will be very glad to help you out.

The types map in `gtad.yaml` is the central switchboard when it comes to matching OpenAPI types with C++ (and Qt) ones. It uses the following type attributes aside from pretty obvious "imports:":
* `avoidCopy` - this attribute defines whether a const ref should be used instead of a value. For basic types like int this is obviously unnecessary; but compound types like `QVector` should rather be taken by reference when possible.
* `moveOnly` - some types are not copyable at all and must be moved instead (an obvious example is anything "tainted" with a member of type `std::unique_ptr<>`).
* `useOmittable` - wrap types that have no value with "null" semantics (i.e. number types and custom-defined data structures) into a special `Omittable<>` template defined in `converters.h`, a drop-in upgrade over `std::optional`.
* `omittedValue` - an alternative for `useOmittable`, just provide a value used for an omitted parameter. This is used for bool parameters which normally are considered false if omitted (or they have an explicit default value, passed in the "official" GTAD's `defaultValue` variable).
* `initializer` - this is a _partial_ (see GTAD and Mustache documentation for explanations but basically it's a variable that is a Mustache template itself) that specifies how exactly a default value should be passed to the parameter. E.g., the default value for a `QString` parameter is enclosed into `QStringLiteral`.

Instead of relying on the event structure definition in the OpenAPI files, `gtad.yaml` uses pointers to libQuotient's event structures: `EventPtr`, `RoomEventPtr` and `StateEventPtr`. Respectively, arrays of events, when encountered in OpenAPI definitions, are converted to `Events`, `RoomEvents` and `StateEvents` containers. When there's no way to figure the type from the definition, an opaque `QJsonObject` is used, leaving the conversion to the library and/or client code.

## How to check proposed changes before submitting them

Checking the code on at least one configuration is essential; if you only have
a hasty fix that doesn't even compile, better make an issue and put a link to
your commit into it (with an explanation what it is about and why).

### Standard checks

The following warnings configuration is applied with GCC and Clang when using CMake:
`-W -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror=return-type -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-gnu-zero-variadic-macro-arguments`
(the last one is to mute a warning triggered by Qt code for debug logging).
We don't turn most of the warnings to errors but please treat them as such.
If you use Qt Creator, the following line can be used with the Clang code model:
`-Weverything -Werror=return-type -Wno-c++98-compat -Wno-c++98-compat-pedantic -Wno-unused-macros -Wno-newline-eof -Wno-exit-time-destructors -Wno-global-constructors -Wno-gnu-zero-variadic-macro-arguments -Wno-documentation -Wno-missing-prototypes -Wno-shadow-field-in-constructor -Wno-padded -Wno-weak-vtables -Wno-unknown-attributes -Wno-comma -Wno-string-conversion -Wno-return-std-move-in-c++11`.

### Continuous Integration

We use CI to check buildability and smoke-testing on Linux (GCC, Clang),
MacOS (Clang), and Windows (MSVC). Every PR will go through these, and you'll
see the traffic lights from them on the PR page. If your PR fails
on any platform double-check that it's not your code causing it - and fix
(or ask how to fix if you don't know) if it is.

### clang-format

We strongly recommend using clang-format (version 10 or newer) or, even better,
use an IDE that supports it. This will lay over a tedious task of following
the assumed code style from your shoulders (and fingers) to your computer.

### Other tools

Recent versions of Qt Creator and CLion can automatically run your code through
clang-tidy. The source code contains `.clang-tidy` file with the recommended
set of checks that doesn't give too many false positives.

Qt Creator in addition knows about clazy, a Qt-aware static analysis tool that
hunts for Qt-specific issues that are easy to overlook otherwise, such as
possible unintended copying of a Qt container. Most of clazy checks are relevant
to our code, except:
`fully-qualified-moc-types,overloaded-signal,qstring-comparison-to-implicit-char,foreach,non-pod-global-static,qstring-allocations,jni-signatures,qt4-qstring-from-array`.

### Submitting API changes

If you changed the API definitions, the path to upstream becomes somewhat
intricate, as you have to coordinate with two projects, making up to 4 PRs along
the way. The recommended sequence depends on whether or not you have to
[write a Matrix Spec Change aka MSC](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals).
Usually you have to, unless your API changes keep API semantics intact.
In that case:
1. Submit an MSC before submitting changes to the API definition files and
   libQuotient.
2. The MSC gets reviewed by the Spec Core Team. This can be a lengthy process
   but it's necessary for the Matrix ecosystem integrity.
3. When your MSC has at least some approvals (not necessarily a complete
   acceptance but at least some approvals should be there) submit a PR to
   libQuotient, referring to your `matrix-spec` repo. Make sure that generated
   files are committed separately from non-generated ones (no need to make two
   PRs; just separate them in different commits).
4. If/when your libQuotient PR is approved and MSC is not there yet you'll
   be asked to submit a PR with API definition files at
   `https://github.com/quotient-im/matrix-spec`. Note that this is _not_
   an official repo; but you can refer to your libQuotient PR as
   an _implementation_ of the MSC - a necessary step before making a so-called
   "spec PR".
5. Once MSC is accepted, submit your `matrix-spec` changes as a PR to
   `https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec` (the "spec PR" mentioned above).
   This will require that your submission meets the standards set by this
   project (they are quite reasonable and not too hard to meet).

If your changes don't need an MSC, it becomes a more straightforward combination
of 2 PRs: one to `https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec` ("spec PR") and one
to libQuotient (with the same guidance about putting generated and non-generated
files in different commits).

## Git commit messages

When writing git commit messages, try to follow the guidelines in
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

1.  Separate subject from body with a blank line
2.  Be reasonable on the subject line length, because this is what we see in commit logs. Try to fit in 50 characters whenever possible.
3.  Capitalize the subject line
4.  Do not end the subject line with a period
5.  Use the imperative mood in the subject line (*command* form)
  (we don't always practice this ourselves but let's try).
6.  Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
    (git tracks how it was changed in detail, don't repeat that). Sometimes a quick overview of "how" is acceptable if a commit is huge - but maybe split a commit into smaller ones, to begin with?

## Reuse (libraries, frameworks, etc.)

C++ is unfortunately not very coherent about SDK/package management, and we try to keep building the library as easy as possible. Because of that we are very conservative about adding dependencies to libQuotient. That relates to additional Qt components and even more to other libraries. Fortunately, even the Qt components now in use (Qt Core and Network) are very feature-rich and provide plenty of ready-made stuff.

Some cases need additional explanation:
* Before rolling out your own super-optimised container or algorithm written
  from scratch, take a good long look through documentation on Qt and
  C++ standard library. Please try to reuse the existing facilities
  as much as possible.
* libQuotient is a library to build Qt applications; for that reason,
  components from KDE Frameworks should be really lightweight and useful
  to be accepted as a dependency. If the intention is to better integrate
  libQuotient into KDE environment there's nothing wrong in building another
  library on top of libQuotient. Consider people who run LXDE and normally
  don't have KDE frameworks installed (some even oppose installing those) -
  libQuotient caters to them too.
* Never forget that libQuotient is aimed to be a non-visual library;
  QtGui in dependencies is only driven by (entirely offscreen) dealing with
  QImages. While there's a bunch of visual code (in C++ and QML) shared
  between Quotient-enabled _applications_, this is likely to end up
  in a separate (Quotient-backed) library, rather than libQuotient itself.
